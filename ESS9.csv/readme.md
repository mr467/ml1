# Machine Learning 1 

## Group project Authors: Milica, Nuria and Marco Initial setup: 30.09.2022

Update 5.10.2022: Added data set to import

Update 6.11.2022: Change in group setup - Nuria canceled - therefore Milica and Marco will work on the subject. The tasks of Nuria are split among the two. Tasks for GAM and linear models are now by Milica and Marco.

## European Survey - What is the political sentiment in Europe Before Covid?

-   Project Description

This project has the goal to apply machine learning models to a real world data set and gain insights from the data. Applying linear models, GLM, GAM, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

-   How to Install and Run the Project This project is based on R. We provide a knitted html and pdf doc based on R Markdown.

-   Include credits Milica & Marco (Nuria till end of Oktober)


### Attention
- There has been some issues with the knitting even though we tried to limit our HTML output to the 30 pages (including the r-Chunk code include = FALSE, where it is necessary). However this did not work. We have an older version of the html file but without the conclusion and a lot of the interpretation. We hope this works to show you that we tried to include the right amount of pages but technology came in the way. 
However our .Rmd has everything and is in the latest version. Here we had to omit the include = FALSE code so that there is no problem with parsing. 

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.
